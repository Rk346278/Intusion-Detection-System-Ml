# Intusion-Detection-System-Ml
ML-based Intrusion Detection System built with Python/Scapy to capture and analyze live network packets. Implemented Isolation Forest (unsupervised ML) for anomaly detection on real-time data. Project strengthened skills in DSA, efficient data pipeline design, and visualization of network threat patterns.
